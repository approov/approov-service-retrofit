# Approov Service for Retrofit

A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://github.com/approov/approov-android-sdk) to enable easy integration when using [`Retrofit`](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for making the API calls that you wish to protect with Approov. In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.

See [Java](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-android-java-retrofit) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-android-kotlin-retrofit) quickstarts for instructions on how to use this.
